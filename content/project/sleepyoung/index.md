This research aims to make the first steps towards developing an intervention which will improve the sleep health of newly licenced novice drivers and consequently reduce sleepiness-related road crashes. Young drivers are at a disproportionately greater risk of sleep-related crashes than older drivers. Traditionally, interventions to reduce driver sleepiness have been passive strategies targeted at the general population such as the introduction of *“Tiredness kills take a break”* signs along motorways. This research addresses the gap by targeting those most at risk. A range of techniques (survey, focus group, expert panel interviews) will be used to understand situational factors which exacerbate young drivers risk and select intervention features with the greatest potential to be effective. Ultimately, considerations and practical guidelines will be developed to support  intervention development for enabling young drivers to  reduce their own risk of sleep-related crashes. 

The project is funded by UK Department for Transport.
