[ICAROS (International Research Centre to Investigate the Effects of Vehicle Automation on Vulnerable Road Users)](https://icaros.lboro.ac.uk/) – part-funded by Research England – brings together researchers from  Loughborough’s University’s Transport Safety Research Center(TSRC), Queensland University  of Technology and Tongji University. The International research centre – led by TSRC– investigates the safety of vulnerable road users (VRU) as driverless cars – or connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) – become more prevalent. ICAROS is nominated for a Loughborough University CALIBRE award https://www.lboro.ac.uk/research/calibre-awards/nominees/icaros/.
