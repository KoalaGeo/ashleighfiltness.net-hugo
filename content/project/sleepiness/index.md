I have always enjoyed sleeping, and have a high sleep ability, I first became interested in sleep from an academic point of view while studying for my Undergraduate Degree in Human Biology at Loughborough University. During the course I took a sleep module which opened my eyes (!) to the huge topic that is sleep research. I went on to complete my Ph.D investigating Obstructive Sleep Apnoea and Daytime driver sleepiness and have been facilitated with how sleepiness and safety interact ever since. 

Example Sleep research projects
- OSA and driving
- iDreams
- Sleep crashes
- Sleep in new mothers
