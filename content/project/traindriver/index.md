A signal passed at danger (SPAD) is considered one of the biggest safety breaches in rail. A series of focus groups with train drivers were conducted to discuss factors which can contribute to SPADS. This project used the existing focus groups to complete a targeted analysis of all mentions of fatigue or sleepiness. Drivers at all focus groups experienced fatigue/sleepiness despite each organisation having countermeasures in place aiming to reduce fatigue/sleepiness. Organisational culture was a barrier to effective fatigue/sleepiness management.
