Over a series of investigations I have worked with police recorded crash data, and self-report experience of those who have had a sleep-related crash to identify common characteristics of sleep crashes. Our findings have show that:
- Sleep crashes are more common on high speed than low speed roads.
- When sleep crashes do happen on low speed roads they have more severe outcomes than not sleep related crashes on the same roads. 
- Sleep related crashes on low and high speed roads have similar characteristics: younger drivers (16-24y) are over represented, males are over represented, more likely to hit a stationary object, greater likelihood of severe outcome. 
- Sleep related crashes are under reported, many people who have had a sleep related crash report that the police were not informed. 
- Some jurisdictions who recognise the under reporting of sleep related crashes apply a proxy definition making an assumption that all crashes that fit set criteria are treated as sleep related. 
- Applying a proxy definition can influence the overall observed characteristics of sleep crashes.
