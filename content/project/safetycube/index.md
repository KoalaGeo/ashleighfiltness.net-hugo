SafetyCube (Safety CaUsation, Benefits and Efficiency) was a research project funded by the European Commission under  Horizon 2020, the objective of SafetyCube was to develop an [innovative road safety Decision Support System (DSS)](https://www.safetycube-project.eu/safetycube-decision-support-system-may-2015/) which enables policy-makers and stakeholders to select and implement the most appropriate strategies, measures and cost-effective approaches to reduce all road user casualties. The significance of this work was recognised by a [Prince Michael International Road Safety Award in 2019](https://www.roadsafetyawards.com/safetycube)
