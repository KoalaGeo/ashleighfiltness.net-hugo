## Sleepiness

I have always enjoyed sleeping, and have a high sleep ability, I first became interested in sleep from an academic point of view while studying for my Undergraduate Degree in Human Biology at Loughborough University. During the corse I took a sleep module which opened my eyes (!) to the huge topic that is sleep research. I went on to complete my Ph.D investigating Obstructive Sleep Apnoea and Daytime driver sleepiness and have been facilitated with how sleepiness and safety interact ever since. 

Example Sleep research projects
- OSA and driving
- Occupational 
- iDreams
- Sleep crashes
- Sleep in new mothers

## Fatigue (strange emoji)
As a sleepiness and fatigue researcher I am innately aware if the difference between these two interacting concepts, while being conscious that for the majority of the population the terms are interchangeable. To me sleepiness is biological, it is influence by how long it has been since you last slept, and your body clock. The feeling of sleepiness can only be mitigated by sleeping or by changing your biology with a chemical compound such as caffeine that acts on the brain. On the other hand, fatigue can have many causes. It is usually associated with having to sustain an activity for a long period of time, overload or underload. If you have been performing a monotonous task for a very long time and it is becoming boring and difficult to concentrate on, doing a different task often makes the fatigue go away. But if you were sleepy it would not matter if you changed the task because you would actually be carrying the sleepiness along with you. In my research I often consider both fatigue and sleepiness, seeking to understand the contributing factors to both and how to best mitigate the impact on safety 
Example fatigue related projects include
- Occupational
- iDreams

## Transport safety (accident tipping car)

Throughout my academic career I have always worked in dedicated transport/road safety centres, firstly at Monash University Accident Research Centre (MUARC), Monash University, then at the Centre for Accident Research and Road Safety - Queensland (CARRS-Q), QUT and most recently at the Transport Safety Research Centre (TSRC), Loughborough University. I have experience researching a range of transport safety topics including topics related to: driver sleepiness, driver fatigue, alcohol impairment, drug driving, situation awareness, driving in road works, co-location of road signs, road user differences (pedestrian, motorcycle, driver, cyclist), automated vehicles, vulnerable road users, evidence based policy making

Example Transport safety related projects include:
- Safety Cube
- ICAROS
 
## Research methods (brain)

I am experienced at a range of quantitative and qualitative research methods. In starting every new project, the first step is to identify the most appropriate method to investigate the research question of interest. 

## Rail safety (train)

## Ballooning safety
