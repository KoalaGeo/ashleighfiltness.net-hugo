I am available for consultancy research, I regularly work with companies, organisations and government departments to investigate how human factors influence safety, in order to identify weaknesses and suggest potential solutions. In particular I specialise in reducing the impact of sleepiness and fatigue on safety.  

I am also available to speak on topics related to sleep, fatigue, promoting higher education particularly for 'first in family', dyslexic students, and, girls into science and academic careers.  

I am very open to academic research collaboration and welcome contact from interested potential Ph.D students and research interns. 

You can contact me by email or twitter.  I will get back to you as soon as possible. Thank you!
