I am available for consultancy research, I regularly work with companies, organisations and government departments to investigate human factors contributors to safety concerns, in order to identify weaknesses and suggest potential solutions. In particular I specialise in reducing the impact of sleepiness and fatigue on safety.  

I am also available to speak on topics related to sleep, fatigue, promoting higher education particularly for first in family and dyslexic students,  girls into science and academic career.  

I am very open to academic research collaboration and welcome contact from interested potential Ph.D students and research interns. 

You can contact me by email or twitter.  I will get back to you as soon as possible. Thank you!
