abstract: "The third edition of the Australian Standard AS1742 Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices Part 7
provides a method of calculating the sighting distance required to safely proceed at passive level crossings
based on the physics of moving vehicles. This required distance becomes greater with higher line speeds
and slower, heavier vehicles so that it may return quite a long sighting distance. However, at such distances,
there are also concerns around whether drivers would be able to reliably identify a train in order to make an
informed decision regarding whether it would be safe to proceed across the level crossing. In order to
determine whether drivers are able to make reliable judgements to proceed in these circumstances, this
study assessed the distance at which a train first becomes identifiable to a driver as well as their, ability to
detect the movement of the train. A site was selected in Victoria, and 36 participants with good visual acuity
observed 4 trains in the 100-140 km/h range. While most participants could detect the train from a very long
distance (2.2 km on average), they could only detect that the train was moving at much shorter distances
(1.3 km on average). Large variability was observed between participants, with 4 participants consistently
detecting trains later than other participants. Participants tended to improve in their capacity to detect the
presence of the train with practice, but a similar trend was not observed for detection of the movement of the
train. Participants were consistently poor at accurately judging the approach speed of trains, with large
underestimations at all investigated distances. "
