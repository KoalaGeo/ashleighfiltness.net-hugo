abstract: "Although much is known regarding driver-related crash contributory factors, less is known
regarding the crash contributory factors that reside outside of the driver, vehicle and road
infrastructure. This article presents the findings from a study in which a systems thinking
framework was used to collect and analyse data on the system-wide contributory factors
underpinning the so called “fatal five” crash-related driver behaviours: drug and drink driving,
distraction and inattention, failure to wear a seat belt, speeding, and fatigue. The study included a
survey on drivers’ perceptions of causes of the each behaviour and a workshop with road safety
experts. The data was analysed and mapped onto a systems model of the Queensland road transport
system. In addition to well-known driver-centric contributory factors, factors related to road safety
strategy and policy, design standards, road rules and regulations, and societal issues generally were
identified. "
