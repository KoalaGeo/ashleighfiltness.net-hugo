abstract: "Heading for breakfast after a perfect flight is the best reward for an exciting morning of hot air ballooning. But how often do we stop and assess the measures that were taken to ensure the flight was safe? While nearly every balloon flight ends safely, with every flight comes the opportunity for an accident. In fact internationally, within sports aviation the frequency of hot air ballooning incidents is second only to gliders. "
