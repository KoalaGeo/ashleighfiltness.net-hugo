abstract: "Multiple barriers have been identified that prevent some Indigenous Australians from obtaining a
licence. A scoping review of the literature was conducted to identify interventions that are used to
address these barriers. Limited research was identified, none of which assessed the suitability of
technological interventions such as PC-based training or driving simulators. Following this,
Indigenous community members in regional Queensland were consulted to gain insight into the
appropriateness and perceived usefulness of a PC-based hazard perception training intervention.
Diverse experiences of drivers and differing preferences to delivery mode and content highlight the
importance of driver education interventions to be flexible."
