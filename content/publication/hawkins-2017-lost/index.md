abstract: "Young drivers have more control over the media they consume than previous generations.
Humour is one strategy which may increase the likelihood of a video being watched and
remembered. Advertisements available on internet sites have a global audience. Ten young,
Australian drivers were asked to view and discuss an international, humorous, animated driver
sleepiness advertisement that had more than 1 million YouTube views. Participants reported
humour and animation to be video features which made inappropriate light of a serious topic.
This negative reception was minimized if viewers were able to interpret actions of how to
manage sleepiness from the video"
