abstract: "The EU research project SafetyCube (Safety CaUsation, Benefits and Efficiency)isdeveloping an innovative road safety Decision Support System (DSS)collecting the available evidence on a broad range of road risks and possible  countermeasures.The  structure  underlying the  DSS consists of (1) a  taxonomy  identifying risk  factors and  measures  and  linking  them  to  each  other,  (2)  a  repository  of  studies,  and  (3)  synopses  summarizing  the effects  estimated  in  the  literature  for  each  risk  factor  and  measure,  and  (4)  an  economic  efficiency  evaluation (E3-calculator).The  DSS isimplemented  in  a modern  web-based  tool  with  a  highly  ergonomic  interface, allowing  users  to  get  a  quick  overview  or  go  deeper  into  the  results  of  single  studies  according  to  their  own needs."
